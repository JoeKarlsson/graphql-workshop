## Refactor and Webpack integration

This section covers how to integrate webpack and how to break up your react project into similar components. It also covers adding webpack middleware into an express project so there is only one build.

Note: I added my production webpack build, but feel free to use a more simple webpack config file.

## What is Webpack?

webpack is a module bundler. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

### Getting Started
* run `npm start`
